# Struct Layout
[Struct Layout](https://structlayout.herokuapp.com/) is a website that generates C
or C++ code from `struct` and `class` definitions in C or C++. The generated code
displays the size, offset, and padding for each field in the each type.

Struct Layout uses the following other projects:

* The [layout utility](https://github.com/joshpeterson/layout)
* [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)
* The [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/) code editor
